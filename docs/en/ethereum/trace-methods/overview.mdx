# Ethereum Trace Methods

This section documents Ethereum's trace API methods that provide detailed execution traces for transactions and blocks. These methods are instrumental for developers needing in-depth visibility into transaction execution, contract interactions, and state changes.

## Trace Methods Overview

Trace methods allow developers to obtain comprehensive execution traces for transactions and blocks, providing visibility into the complete call hierarchy, state changes, and execution flow. These powerful tools enable advanced debugging, analytics, and monitoring capabilities essential for sophisticated Ethereum applications.

The trace namespace provides methods for:

- Obtaining detailed traces for individual transactions
- Tracing all transactions within a block
- Replaying transactions with different parameters
- Filtering traces based on specific criteria
- Executing trace calls without modifying state
- Analyzing internal transactions and contract calls

These methods are particularly valuable for:
- Smart contract debugging and validation
- Transaction analysis tools
- Monitoring contract interactions
- Forensic blockchain analysis
- Gas optimization research

Each trace method provides structured output detailing call hierarchies, executed opcodes, gas consumption, and state modifications at each step of execution.
