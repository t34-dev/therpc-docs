# Frequently Asked Questions

## # Authentication & Access

- #### How do I get an API key?

  Sign up at TheRPC.io and navigate to the dashboard to generate your API key. Each key has its own rate limits and permissions.

- #### Can I use multiple API keys?

  Yes, you can create multiple API keys for different applications or environments. This helps with monitoring usage and maintaining security.

- #### What happens if my API key is compromised?
  Immediately revoke the compromised key from your dashboard and generate a new one. Your old key will stop working instantly.

## # API Usage

### What's the difference between HTTP and WebSocket endpoints?

- **HTTP**: Best for single requests and simple integrations. Use methods like <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_blockNumber" title="Method to get the current block number">eth_blockNumber</Link> or <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_getBalance" title="Method to retrieve an account's ETH balance">eth_getBalance</Link>
- **WebSocket**: Ideal for real-time data and subscriptions to events like <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_subscribe" title="Method to subscribe to real-time blockchain events">eth_subscribe</Link>

### How do I handle rate limits?

Implement exponential backoff when you receive rate limit errors. Consider upgrading your plan if you consistently hit limits.

### What are the recommended timeout settings?

We recommend:

- HTTP requests: 30-second timeout
- WebSocket connections: 60-second ping/pong interval
- Subscription operations: 30-second timeout

## # Error Handling

### Common Error Codes

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"error": {
		"code": -32601,
		"message": "Method not found"
	},
	"id": 1
}
```

- `-32700`: Parse error
- `-32600`: Invalid request
- `-32601`: Method not found
- `-32602`: Invalid params
- `-32603`: Internal error
- `-32000 to -32099`: Server error

### Best Practices for Error Handling

1. Always check the response for an `error` field
2. Implement proper retry logic with backoff
3. Log detailed error information for debugging
4. Handle network timeouts appropriately

## # Technical Questions

### How do I track pending transactions?

Use <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_getTransactionReceipt" title="Method to get transaction receipt and confirmation status">eth_getTransactionReceipt</Link> to poll for transaction status. For real-time updates, subscribe to pending transactions via <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_subscribe" title="Method to subscribe to real-time blockchain events">eth_subscribe</Link> using WebSocket.

```javascript
// Example of transaction tracking
const receipt = await web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash);
if (receipt) {
	console.log(`Transaction confirmed in block ${receipt.blockNumber}`);
}
```

### How can I ensure my requests are processed in order?

Use the `nonce` parameter for transactions and maintain a queue in your application for sequential processing. You can get the current nonce using <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_getTransactionCount" title="Method to get the transaction count (nonce) for an account">eth_getTransactionCount</Link>.

### What's the recommended way to handle chain reorganizations?

1. Wait for sufficient block confirmations using <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_blockNumber" title="Method to get the current block number">eth_blockNumber</Link>
2. Listen for `newHeads` events through <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_subscribe" title="Method to subscribe to real-time blockchain events">eth_subscribe</Link>
3. Verify transaction finality using <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_getBlockByNumber" title="Method to get block information by block number">eth_getBlockByNumber</Link>

## # Performance

### How can I optimize my API usage?

1. Batch related requests when possible
2. Use WebSocket for real-time data through <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_subscribe" title="Method to subscribe to real-time blockchain events">eth_subscribe</Link>
3. Implement proper caching
4. Choose appropriate polling intervals

### What are the best practices for high-throughput applications?

1. Use connection pooling
2. Implement request queuing
3. Monitor rate limits
4. Consider dedicated infrastructure

## # Network Specific

### How do I switch between networks?

Simply use the appropriate endpoint for each network while maintaining the same API key and request format. You can verify the network using <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/net_version" title="Method to get the current network ID">net_version</Link>.

### Can I use the same code for different networks?

Yes, our API provides consistent interfaces across networks. Just update the endpoint URL for different networks. You can check the chain ID using <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_chainId" title="Method to get the current chain ID">eth_chainId</Link>.

## # Development & Integration

### Which Web3 library should I use?

- **JavaScript**: web3.js or ethers.js
- **Python**: web3.py
- **Java**: web3j
- **Other languages**: See our <Link to="/docs/tools/overview" title="Overview of tools for different programming languages">Tools & SDKs</Link> section

### How do I test my integration?

1. Start with testnet endpoints
2. Use our test API keys
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Validate responses using methods like <Link to="/docs/ethereum/core-methods/eth_blockNumber" title="Method to get the current block number">eth_blockNumber</Link>
5. Monitor performance
