# eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas

The `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` method returns the recommended priority fee (tip) per gas unit that should be included in EIP-1559 transactions. This value represents what validators are currently expecting as an incentive to include transactions in blocks.

## Use Cases

- Fee market analysis for blockchain researchers
- Transaction fee optimization for wallets and dApps
- EIP-1559 transaction construction in applications
- Gas price strategy development for high-priority operations
- Priority estimation for time-sensitive transactions
- DApp gas price suggestions for better user experience
- Monitoring validator incentives in real-time
- Optimizing transaction costs during network congestion
- Setting appropriate fees for smart contract deployments
- Building fee estimators for wallet applications

## Method Details

This method provides the current recommended priority fee in wei.

<ApiMethodBlock
	chain="ethereum"
	scheme={{
		method: 'eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas',
		id: 1,
		jsonrpc: '2.0',
	}}
	fields={[]}
	returns={[
		{
			id: 'result',
			type: 'string',
			desc: 'The recommended priority fee in wei (hexadecimal)',
		},
	]}
	getParams={() => []}
/>

### Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"result": "0x3b9aca00" // 1 Gwei (1,000,000,000 wei)
}
```

### Understanding Priority Fees

The priority fee is a component of the EIP-1559 fee structure:

- **Base Fee**: Algorithmically determined, burned upon transaction inclusion
- **Priority Fee (tip)**: Optional payment to validators for transaction inclusion
- **Max Fee**: Maximum amount a user is willing to pay (includes both base fee and priority fee)

The priority fee serves as an incentive for validators to include a transaction in their block. Higher priority fees generally result in faster transaction inclusion, especially during periods of network congestion.

### Important Notes

- Priority fees fluctuate based on network demand
- For time-sensitive transactions, consider using a higher priority fee
- During periods of low network activity, the minimum priority fee (often 1 Gwei) is usually sufficient
- This method reflects the node's estimation, other nodes may have slightly different estimates
- This method is only relevant for networks that support EIP-1559 (Ethereum post-London fork)
- Even with a high priority fee, inclusion is not guaranteed during extreme congestion
- Priority fees can vary significantly during NFT drops and other high-demand events
- Different validators may have different strategies for transaction selection
- Historical fee data (via eth_feeHistory) can provide context for current priority fee recommendations
- Some wallets and dApps implement their own fee estimation algorithms that may differ from the node's suggestion
