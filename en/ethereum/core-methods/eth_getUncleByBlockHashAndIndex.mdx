## Understanding Uncle Blocks

Uncle blocks (also called ommers) are valid blocks that were mined but not included in the main blockchain. This happens when two miners find a valid block at nearly the same time, but only one can be accepted into the main chain.

### Why Uncle Blocks Matter

- **Network Security**: A high uncle rate may indicate network latency or high mining competition
- **Rewards**: Miners of uncle blocks receive partial rewards (2/32 of block reward pre-EIP-1559)
- **Block Inclusion**: Uncles are referenced in regular blocks (up to 2 per block)
- **Chain Confirmation**: Uncles contribute to blockchain security despite not being in the main chain

### Uncle Rewards Calculation

Uncle block miners receive rewards based on the formula:

```
((Uncle Block Number + 8) - Main Block Number) * (Block Reward / 8)
```

Where:
- Uncle Block Number is the block number of the uncle block
- Main Block Number is the block number that included the uncle reference
- Block Reward is the standard block reward (varies by network upgrade)

### Important Notes

- Uncle blocks contain header information only, no transactions
- Uncles must be within 6 blocks of the including block
- Post-Merge (PoS), uncles no longer exist as validators produce blocks in slots
- The uncle rate is an important network health metric
- Uncle information can be vital for analyzing historical blockchain data
