# net_version

The `net_version` method returns the current network ID as a string. This allows applications to determine which Ethereum network the client is connected to, such as mainnet, testnets, or other EVM-compatible networks.

## Use Cases

- Network verification before sending transactions
- Cross-chain compatibility checks in multi-chain applications
- Environment-specific functionality for dApps
- Security validations to prevent sending to wrong networks
- Multi-network dApp development and testing
- Preventing accidental testnet vs mainnet operations
- Smart contract deployment verification
- Wallet network switching confirmation
- Transaction validation safety checks
- Network-specific feature enablement

## Method Details

This method requires no parameters and returns a string value representing the network ID.

<ApiMethodBlock
	chain="ethereum"
	scheme={{
		method: 'net_version',
		id: 67,
		jsonrpc: '2.0',
	}}
	fields={[]}
	returns={[
		{
			id: 'result',
			type: 'string',
			desc: 'The current network ID as a string',
		},
	]}
	getParams={() => []}
/>

### Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 67,
	"result": "1" // Ethereum Mainnet
}
```

### Important Notes

- Network ID is returned as a string, not a number
- Network ID is sometimes the same as Chain ID, but not always
- Some networks may change their network ID over time
- Always verify network ID when developing cross-chain applications
- For security-critical applications, consider using multiple verification methods
- EIP-155 introduced Chain ID for replay protection, which is different from Network ID in some cases
- For transaction signing, Chain ID (from `eth_chainId`) is usually more relevant than Network ID

### Difference Between Network ID and Chain ID

- **Network ID**: Identifies the network in the P2P protocol
- **Chain ID**: Used for transaction signing to prevent replay attacks
- For most networks, they are the same value, but there are exceptions
- Always use the appropriate ID for the specific use case
