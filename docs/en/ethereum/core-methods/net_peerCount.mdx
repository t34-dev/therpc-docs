# net_peerCount

The `net_peerCount` method returns the number of peers currently connected to the client. This method provides essential insight into the node's connectivity within the Ethereum network and helps diagnose network issues.

## Use Cases

- Network health monitoring for blockchain applications
- Node connectivity verification during setup and maintenance
- Sync status troubleshooting when blocks aren't updating
- Network size estimation for research purposes
- Node performance analysis and optimization
- Connection quality assessment before critical operations
- Identifying isolated nodes that might miss transactions
- Verifying proper network configuration
- Monitoring node health in production environments
- Detecting connectivity problems in automated systems

## Method Details

This method requires no parameters and returns a hexadecimal encoded integer.

<ApiMethodBlock
	chain="ethereum"
	scheme={{
		method: 'net_peerCount',
		id: 67,
		jsonrpc: '2.0',
	}}
	fields={[]}
	returns={[
		{
			id: 'result',
			type: 'string',
			desc: 'The number of connected peers (hexadecimal)',
		},
	]}
	getParams={() => []}
/>

### Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 67,
	"result": "0x1a" // 26 connected peers
}
```

### Understanding the Results

The response is a hexadecimal string representation of the number of connected peers. For example:

- `"0x0"` = 0 peers
- `"0xa"` = 10 peers
- `"0x1a"` = 26 peers
- `"0x64"` = 100 peers

### Peer Count Significance

The number of peers can indicate several things about your node:

- **0 peers**: The node is completely isolated from the network
- **1-5 peers**: The node has minimal connectivity
- **10-30 peers**: Normal range for most Ethereum nodes
- **30+ peers**: High connectivity, typical for public nodes or validators

### Important Notes

- A low peer count might indicate network connectivity issues
- Some private nodes might intentionally limit peer connections
- Public nodes usually maintain more peer connections
- The peer count is constantly changing as nodes join and leave the network
- The reported number includes only direct peer connections
- For hosted nodes, the peer count might reflect the provider's network rather than your specific instance
- A high peer count doesn't necessarily mean better performance
