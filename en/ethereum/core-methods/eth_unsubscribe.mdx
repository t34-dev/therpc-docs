# eth_unsubscribe

The `eth_unsubscribe` method cancels an existing WebSocket subscription to stop receiving event notifications. This method helps manage resources and network traffic by removing subscriptions that are no longer needed.

## Use Cases

- Stopping event notifications when a user navigates away from a page
- Managing resources on both client and server to prevent memory leaks
- Cleaning up inactive subscriptions after data processing is complete
- Handling application state changes requiring different subscription parameters
- Keeping within provider limits on concurrent subscriptions
- Implementing subscription rotation for high-volume event monitoring
- Ensuring graceful shutdown of dApp event monitoring components
- Switching between different blockchain event types
- Freeing up server resources for other users in multi-tenant environments
- Managing sessions for user-specific event tracking

## Method Details

This method cancels a subscription using its subscription ID.

<ApiMethodBlock

			required: true,
			type: 'string',
			desc: 'The subscription ID to cancel',
			value: '0x9cef478923ff08bf67fde6c64013158d',

### Request Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"method": "eth_unsubscribe",
	"params": ["0x9cef478923ff08bf67fde6c64013158d"]
}
```

### Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"result": true
}
```

### Response Values

- `true`: The subscription was successfully canceled
- `false`: No subscription existed with the given ID

### Error Scenarios

| Error Code | Message | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| -32602 | invalid subscription id | The provided subscription ID does not exist or is invalid |
| -32000 | subscription not found | The subscription was already canceled or never existed |
| -32603 | Internal error | Server encountered an unexpected condition |

### Error Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"error": {
		"code": -32602,
		"message": "invalid subscription id"
	}
}
```

### Important Notes

- This method must be called over the same WebSocket connection that created the subscription
- Closing the WebSocket connection automatically unsubscribes all associated subscriptions
- The subscription ID comes from the result of a previous eth_subscribe call
- You should unsubscribe from subscriptions that are no longer needed to free up server resources
- The same subscription ID cannot be reused after unsubscribing
- Some providers may limit the number of concurrent subscriptions per connection
- Subscription IDs are unique per connection and not globally unique
- If reconnecting to a different server in a load-balanced environment, old subscription IDs will not be valid
- Some RPC providers may automatically unsubscribe inactive subscriptions after a certain period
- Multiple unsubscribe attempts for the same ID are safe but will return false after the first successful attempt
