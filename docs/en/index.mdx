## Getting Started

Our API provides uniform access across all supported blockchains, allowing developers to:

- Query blockchain data
- Submit transactions
- Monitor network events
- Interact with smart contracts

Each blockchain section contains detailed documentation on available methods, request formats, and response examples.

## Connection Methods

Our API supports multiple transport methods:
- **HTTPS** - Available for all chains
- **WebSocket** - Available for most chains except Bitcoin

## Free Access Options

We offer free tier access to select blockchains to help you get started:
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum

Explore our documentation to learn how to integrate these powerful blockchain networks into your applications.
