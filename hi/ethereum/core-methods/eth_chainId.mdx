# eth_chainId

The `eth_chainId` method returns the current network/chain ID, which is crucial for signing replay-protected transactions as introduced in EIP-155. This simple yet essential method helps ensure transactions are executed on the intended network and prevents transaction replay attacks.

## Use Cases

- Verifying the current network connection in wallets and DApps
- Implementing transaction replay protection
- Building network-specific logic in multichain applications
- Cross-chain application development and switching
- Transaction signing validation
- Network detection for user interfaces
- Automated network switching in web3 applications

## Method Details

This is a straightforward query method that returns the chain ID of the connected network in hexadecimal format. It requires no parameters and is extremely lightweight.

<ApiMethodBlock
	chain="ethereum"
	scheme={{
		method: 'eth_chainId',
		id: 1,
		jsonrpc: '2.0',
	}}
	fields={[]}
	returns={[
		{
			id: 'result',
			type: 'string',
			desc: 'The chain ID in hexadecimal format',
		},
	]}
	getParams={() => []}
/>

### Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"result": "0x1" // Represents Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1)
}
```

### Common Chain IDs

- 0x1 (1): Ethereum Mainnet
- 0x5 (5): Goerli Testnet
- 0xAA36A7 (11155111): Sepolia Testnet 
- 0x89 (137): Polygon Mainnet
- 0xA (10): Optimism
- 0xA4B1 (42161): Arbitrum One
- 0x38 (56): BNB Smart Chain
- 0xA86A (43114): Avalanche C-Chain

### Understanding EIP-155

EIP-155 introduced replay protection by including the chain ID in transaction signatures. Prior to this improvement, a transaction signed for one network could potentially be replayed on another network or fork. The `eth_chainId` method is essential for implementing this protection, as it allows applications to get the correct chain ID value to include in transaction signatures.
