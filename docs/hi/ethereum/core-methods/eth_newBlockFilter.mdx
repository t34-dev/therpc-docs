# eth_newBlockFilter

The `eth_newBlockFilter` method creates a filter in the node to notify when a new block arrives. This is a simpler and more efficient alternative to polling `eth_blockNumber` repeatedly, as it allows you to receive notifications only when new blocks are detected.

## Use Cases

- Block synchronization for applications and explorers
- Triggering block-based actions in automated systems
- Confirmation tracking for transactions in wallets
- Chain reorganization detection for data integrity
- Real-time blockchain monitoring for analytics
- Gas price trend monitoring for fee optimization
- Mining/validation tracking in network analysis
- Detecting network stalls when blocks stop arriving
- Alerting systems for blockchain infrastructure
- Maintaining cache consistency with blockchain state

## Method Details

This method takes no parameters and returns a filter ID that can be used with `eth_getFilterChanges` to poll for new blocks.

<ApiMethodBlock
  chain="ethereum"
  scheme={{
    "method": "eth_newBlockFilter",
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
  }}
  fields={[]}
  returns={[
    {
      id: 'result',
      type: 'string',
      desc: "Filter ID (hex string) used for polling with eth_getFilterChanges"
    }
  ]}
  getParams={() => []}
/>

### Response Example

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x3a85885a2facbe4b9c99d543b3e42359"
}
```

### How Block Filters Work

1. When you create a block filter, the Ethereum node assigns it a unique ID
2. The node keeps track of the latest block it has shown to your filter
3. When you poll using `eth_getFilterChanges`, it returns block hashes for any new blocks since your last poll
4. If no new blocks have been produced, it returns an empty array

### Return Value Format

When polling with `eth_getFilterChanges`, this filter returns an array of block hashes:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": [
    "0x1a4b5aad3a859c5c6cbbdab46f565475c5c61c163a45e0c2cb732e7221efbe77",
    "0x2573c838b310ca595c83c20ee437139f96658f596afe8a0f726d82db3d9647c2"
  ]
}
```

### Block Data Retrieval

The filter only returns block hashes. To get the full block data, you must make additional calls using:

- `eth_getBlockByHash` - Get a block's details using its hash

### Important Considerations

1. **Filter Expiration**: Filters expire after a period of inactivity (typically around 5 minutes)
2. **Polling Frequency**: Balance between timely updates and RPC call limits
3. **Block Reorganizations**: Be aware that blocks can be reorganized, especially recent ones
4. **Chain Consistency**: Block filters help maintain application state in sync with the blockchain
5. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - WebSocket `eth_subscribe` for real-time push notifications
   - Polling `eth_blockNumber` directly (less efficient)
6. **Rate Limits**: Excessive polling can lead to rate limiting from RPC providers
7. **Missing Blocks**: If poll intervals are too large, you might need to handle multiple blocks at once
8. **Filter Management**: Always uninstall filters when no longer needed
9. **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for temporary network issues
10. **Block Processing**: Consider processing blocks sequentially to maintain data consistency
