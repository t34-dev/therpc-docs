# eth_syncing

The `eth_syncing` method allows you to check whether your Ethereum node is currently synchronizing with the network and, if it is, track the progress of the synchronization process. This simple yet powerful method helps you monitor your node's catch-up status.

## Use Cases

- Monitoring node synchronization status in infrastructure setups
- Tracking sync progress in block explorers and dashboards
- Determining when a node is ready to process transactions
- Building health monitoring systems for Ethereum infrastructure
- Calculating estimated time until full sync is complete
- Displaying sync status in wallet applications
- Verifying that a node is fully synchronized before critical operations
- Diagnosing networking or blockchain synchronization issues
- Checking if a node can reliably process requests
- Monitoring initial sync for resource-intensive archive nodes

## Method Details

<ApiMethodBlock
	chain="ethereum"
	scheme={{
		method: 'eth_syncing',
		id: 1,
		jsonrpc: '2.0',
		params: [],
	}}
	fields={[]}
	returns={[
		{
			id: 'syncing',
			type: 'boolean | object',
			desc: 'When the node is not syncing, returns `false`. When syncing, returns an object with sync status data.',
		},
	]}
	getParams={(s) => s.params}
/>

## Response Examples

### When Not Syncing

If the node is fully synchronized with the network, the method returns `false`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": false
}
```

### When Syncing

If the node is currently synchronizing, the method returns an object with sync status information:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "currentBlock": "0x3b0bc5",
    "highestBlock": "0x3b7698",
    "knownStates": "0x21a679",
    "pulledStates": "0x21a679",
    "startingBlock": "0x3ad7a2"
  }
}
```

### Understanding the Sync Status Fields

#### Standard Fields
* **startingBlock**: Hexadecimal block number where the sync started
* **currentBlock**: Hexadecimal block number the node is currently processing
* **highestBlock**: Hexadecimal block number of the highest known block in the network
* **knownStates**: Number of state entries known to exist (from peer information)
* **pulledStates**: Number of state entries already downloaded

#### Additional Client-Specific Fields

Different Ethereum clients may include additional sync information:

##### Geth
* **healedBytecodeBytes**: Bytes of code restored during snap sync
* **healedBytecodes**: Number of bytecodes recovered during snap sync
* **healedTrienodeBytes**: Bytes of trie nodes recovered during healing
* **healedTrienodes**: Number of trie nodes recovered during healing
* **syncedAccountBytes**: Size of account data downloaded
* **syncedAccounts**: Number of accounts downloaded
* **syncedBytecodeBytes**: Size of bytecode downloaded
* **syncedBytecodes**: Number of bytecodes downloaded
* **syncedStorage**: Number of storage slots synced
* **syncedStorageBytes**: Size of storage data downloaded

##### Erigon
* **syncStage**: Current sync stage name (Headers, Bodies, Execution, etc.)
* **syncProgress**: Percentage of current stage completion (0-100)

### Example Data Interpretation

Given this sync status:
```json
{
  "currentBlock": "0x3b0bc5",
  "highestBlock": "0x3b7698",
  "startingBlock": "0x3ad7a2"
}
```

We can interpret it as follows:
- Starting block: 3,840,930 (decimal of 0x3ad7a2)
- Current block: 3,872,709 (decimal of 0x3b0bc5)
- Highest block: 3,897,000 (decimal of 0x3b7698)
- Progress: ~31,779 blocks synced out of ~56,070 total (56.7% complete)

### Sync Types and Phases

Ethereum nodes can sync using different strategies, each affecting what the `eth_syncing` response will show:

#### Full Sync
Downloads all blocks and executes all transactions from the genesis block.
- Slow but most secure
- Can take days or weeks depending on hardware
- Provides full historical data

#### Fast Sync
Downloads blocks but pulls only recent state without re-executing historical transactions.
- Much faster than full sync
- May take hours to days
- Reduces storage requirements
- `eth_syncing` will show state sync progress

#### Snap Sync (Geth)
Directly downloads state snapshots rather than reconstructing state from transactions.
- Fastest sync method for Geth
- Can complete in hours on good hardware
- Additional fields in sync status show snapshot progress

#### Beam Sync (Nethermind)
Allows querying chain data before full sync completes.
- Begins processing requests before fully synchronized
- May show as not syncing even while backfilling data

### Common Sync Phases

1. **Header Sync**: Download block headers (fastest phase)
2. **Block Sync**: Download block bodies
3. **Receipt Sync**: Download transaction receipts
4. **State Sync**: Download or build account and contract state (slowest phase)
5. **Healing**: Verify data integrity and fix any issues

### Synchronization Issues

When monitoring with `eth_syncing`, these patterns may indicate problems:

1. **Stuck Sync**: No change in `currentBlock` for extended periods
2. **Slow Progress**: Very low blocks-per-minute rate
3. **Repeated Blocks**: Current block number decreases or fluctuates
4. **Disconnect/Reconnect**: Sync restarts with a new `startingBlock`

### Sync Status Dashboard

For applications that need to display sync status, consider showing:

1. Visual progress bar based on `currentBlock` vs `highestBlock`
2. Numeric percentage of completion
3. Current block vs highest block
4. Estimated time remaining
5. Current sync stage (if available)
6. Historical sync speed chart
7. Network health indicators


### Important Notes

1. **False Negatives**: Some clients return `false` during certain sync types or stages even when not fully synced
2. **Consensus Layer**: This method only reports execution layer sync status, not consensus layer (post-merge)
3. **Peers Required**: Nodes need peers to accurately determine the highest block
4. **Client Variations**: Different clients (Geth, Erigon, Nethermind, etc.) provide different sync information
5. **Archive Nodes**: Full archive nodes take significantly longer to sync than full nodes with pruning
6. **Disk IO**: Sync speed is often limited by disk I/O performance rather than network
7. **Memory Requirements**: Syncing requires significant RAM, especially during state sync phases
8. **Multiple Sync Methods**: Clients often switch between sync methods during the process
