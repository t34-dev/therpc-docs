# eth_subscribe

The `eth_subscribe` method creates a subscription to specific events on the Ethereum blockchain. It requires a WebSocket connection and allows clients to receive real-time notifications about new blocks, pending transactions, logs, and synchronization status.

## Use Cases

- Building real-time blockchain explorers and dashboards
- Monitoring smart contract events without constant polling
- Creating responsive dApps that update instantly when state changes
- Tracking pending transactions to detect when they're mined
- Receiving immediate notification when a payment arrives
- Implementing efficient event-driven architecture for blockchain applications
- Monitoring smart contract activity with minimal server load
- Building high-performance trading systems requiring real-time data
- Tracking node synchronization in real-time
- Implementing webhooks for blockchain events

## Subscription Types

### newHeads

Subscribe to receive information about new blocks added to the blockchain. This is useful for applications that need to react to new blocks or monitor chain progress.

#### Request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_subscribe",
  "params": ["newHeads"]
}
```

#### Response

Initial response with subscription ID:

#### Key Block Header Fields

The notification includes a complete block header with the following key fields:

- **number**: The block height (hexadecimal)
- **hash**: The block hash (may be null if still pending)
- **parentHash**: Hash of the parent block
- **timestamp**: Unix timestamp when block was mined
- **gasUsed**: Total gas used by all transactions in the block
- **gasLimit**: Maximum gas allowed in the block
- **baseFeePerGas**: Base fee per gas (post-EIP-1559)
- **miner**: Address of the miner/validator who produced the block
- **difficulty**: Block difficulty (will be 0 after The Merge)
- **size**: Size of the block in bytes

### logs

Subscribe to receive logs that match specific filter criteria. This is particularly useful for tracking events emitted by smart contracts.

#### Request with Filter Options

```json
{
  "id": 1,
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"method": "eth_subscribe",
	"params": [
		"logs",
		{
      "address": "0x8320fe7702b96808f7bbc0d4a888ed1468216cfd",
      "topics": ["0xd78a0cb8bb633d06981248b816e7bd33c2a35a6089241d099fa519e361cab902"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Filter Options Explained

The second parameter is a filter object that can include:

- **address** (optional): String or array of strings with addresses to filter logs
- **topics** (optional): Array of topic filters, supports null for wildcard
- **fromBlock** (optional): Block height from which to start getting logs (hexadecimal)
- **toBlock** (optional): Block height to which to get logs (hexadecimal)

#### Topics Array Format

Topics are ordered and correspond to the event signature and indexed parameters:

1. First topic: keccak256 hash of the event signature (e.g., `Transfer(address,address,uint256)`)
2. Second topic: First indexed parameter
3. Third topic: Second indexed parameter (if present)
4. Fourth topic: Third indexed parameter (if present)

Topics can be:
- A single topic: exact match required
- Null: any value accepted (wildcard)
- Array of topics: any of the topics in the array will match (OR condition)

#### Response

Initial response with subscription ID:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x4a8a4c0517381924f9838102c5a4dcb7"
}
```

  }
}
```


## Important Notes

1. **WebSocket Required**: `eth_subscribe` is only available over WebSocket connections, not HTTP
2. **Subscription Limits**: Many providers limit the number of active subscriptions per connection
3. **Missed Events**: If connection drops, events occurring during disconnection are missed
4. **Chain Reorganizations**: Events may be marked as removed during chain reorganizations
5. **Client Support**: Not all Ethereum clients support all subscription types
6. **Public Node Restrictions**: Public nodes like Infura may have throttling for subscriptions
7. **Filter Precision**: More specific filters improve performance and reduce data volume
8. **Security Considerations**: WebSockets have different security requirements than HTTP
9. **Guaranteed Delivery**: Unlike message queues, WebSocket does not guarantee delivery
10. **Connection Stability**: Long-running subscriptions should implement reconnection logic
