# txpool_inspect

The `txpool_inspect` method returns a textual summary of all pending and queued transactions in the transaction pool. This method is primarily supported by Geth clients and provides a human-readable overview of transactions waiting to be included in blocks, without the full transaction details.

## Use Cases

- Monitoring transaction pool status for node health checks
- Debugging stuck transactions in wallets and applications
- Gas price analysis for optimal transaction submission
- Network congestion monitoring and visualization
- Transaction replacement verification (checking if a speed-up worked)
- MEV (Miner Extractable Value) research and analysis
- Node operation diagnostics in infrastructure setups
- Identifying transaction patterns during high network activity
- Monitoring transaction pool for specific addresses
- Observing nonce gaps that might prevent transaction confirmation

## Method Details

This method requires no parameters and returns a structured summary of the transaction pool.

	"result": {
		"pending": {
			"0x0216d5032f356960cd3749c31ab34eeff21b3395": {
				"806": "0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984: 0 wei + 21000 gas × 8000000000 wei"

				"807": "0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D: 0 wei + 189000 gas × 3000000000 wei"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Understanding the Response

The response is structured as follows:

1. **Pending Transactions**: Transactions that are ready to be included in the next blocks.

- Organized by sender address and nonce
- Each entry shows: `recipientAddress: value + gasLimit × gasPrice`

2. **Queued Transactions**: Transactions that cannot yet be executed (e.g., because of a nonce gap).

- Same structure as pending transactions
- Typically have future nonces or other execution constraints

### Transaction State Categories

- **Pending**: Transactions eligible for inclusion in the next block
- Have valid nonces (equal to the sender's current nonce)
- Meet all other validity criteria

- **Queued**: Transactions not yet eligible for execution
- May have future nonces (higher than sender's current nonce + pending count)
- May be waiting for other transactions from the same sender
- May have other constraints preventing immediate execution

### Important Notes

- This method is primarily supported by Geth clients
- Not all Ethereum client implementations support the txpool namespace
- During high network congestion, the response can be very large
- The textual format is designed for human readability rather than programmatic processing
- For more detailed transaction data, consider using `txpool_content` instead
- Pending transactions may not be immediately included in blocks despite being valid
- The transaction pool is dynamic and changes with each new block and incoming transaction
- Some clients may limit the number of transactions shown in the response
