# eth_sendRawTransaction

The `eth_sendRawTransaction` method broadcasts a pre-signed transaction to the Ethereum network. This method is used to submit all types of transactions after they have been signed offline, making it the primary method for any state-changing operations on the blockchain.

## Use Cases

- Sending ETH transfers to other addresses and wallets
- Token transfers (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) in applications
- Smart contract deployments for developers
- Contract function calls and state changes in dApps
- Automated transactions via scripts or bots
- Multi-signature wallet interactions requiring offline signing
- Meta-transactions (gas-less transactions) for better UX
- DeFi operations (swaps, liquidity provision, staking)
- Governance voting through contract interactions
- NFT minting operations in marketplaces

## Method Details

This method submits a signed transaction to the network for processing.

### Transaction Signing Process

Before using `eth_sendRawTransaction`, you need to:

1. Create an unsigned transaction (with nonce, gas parameters, recipient, value, data)
2. Sign the transaction with a private key
3. Serialize and hex-encode the signed transaction
4. Submit the hex string to this method

### Understanding Transaction Types

Ethereum supports different transaction types:

| Type | Description | Structure |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Legacy (Type 0) | Pre-EIP-1559 transactions with gasPrice | `{nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, v, r, s}` |
| EIP-2930 (Type 1) | Transactions with access lists | `{chainId, nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, v, r, s}` |
| EIP-1559 (Type 2) | Transactions with priority fee | `{chainId, nonce, maxPriorityFeePerGas, maxFeePerGas, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, v, r, s}` |

### Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"result": "0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"
}
```

### Error Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"error": {
		"code": 3,
		"message": "execution reverted: Dai/insufficient-balance",
		"data": "0x08c379a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000..."
	}
}
```

### Common Errors and Troubleshooting

| Error | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Nonce too low | The transaction nonce has already been used | Get the latest nonce with `eth_getTransactionCount` |
| Nonce too high | The transaction nonce is higher than expected | Use the correct sequential nonce |
| Insufficient funds | Not enough ETH for gas + value | Add more ETH to the sender address |
| Gas price too low | Offered gas price below minimum | Increase gas price or use EIP-1559 parameters |
| Underpriced replacement | When replacing a tx, new gas price is too low | Increase gas price by at least 10% |
| Already known | Transaction already in the mempool | Wait for the existing transaction |
| Execution reverted | Contract execution failed | Check contract conditions and parameters |

### Monitoring Transaction Status

After broadcasting a transaction:

1. Store the returned transaction hash
2. Poll `eth_getTransactionReceipt` until it returns a non-null result
3. Check the `status` field in the receipt:
   - `0x1` indicates success
   - `0x0` indicates failure (reverted)

### Gas Estimation and Optimization

Before sending transactions, you can:

1. Use `eth_estimateGas` to get the approximate gas needed
2. For EIP-1559 transactions, check current network conditions with `eth_feeHistory`
3. For time-sensitive transactions, set higher priority fees
4. For non-urgent transactions, set lower fees to save costs

### Important Notes

- Transactions must be signed with the sender's private key before submission
- The RPC endpoint never has access to your private keys
- Use eth_getTransactionReceipt to check status after submission
- For contract creation, the receipt contains the new contract address in the contractAddress field
- Hex strings must be properly formatted with even length and '0x' prefix
- Consider using hardware wallets or secure key management for high-value transactions
- Nonce management is critical for proper transaction sequencing
- Transaction replacement requires higher gas price than the original
- Transaction fees are non-refundable even if the transaction fails
- EIP-1559 transactions can be more cost-effective during volatile fee periods
