# Ethereum Debug Methods

This section documents Ethereum's powerful debug API methods that provide advanced capabilities for blockchain analysis, transaction debugging, and detailed state inspection. These methods are essential for developers building sophisticated Ethereum applications, tools, and analytics.

## Debug Methods Overview

Debug methods allow you to perform detailed analysis of blockchain data, trace transaction execution at the EVM level, inspect state changes, and diagnose issues with transactions or smart contracts. These advanced inspection capabilities are crucial for developers working on complex smart contracts or building analytical tools.

The debug namespace provides methods for:

- Tracing transaction execution with granular control over tracing parameters
- Analyzing block execution with different trace types (e.g., call tracer, 4byte tracer)
- Inspecting contract storage and state
- Retrieving information about bad blocks
- Analyzing call and execution contexts

These methods typically provide more detailed output than standard API methods, making them valuable for deep debugging and analysis tasks.
