# eth_uninstallFilter

The `eth_uninstallFilter` method removes a filter with the given ID. It should be used when a filter is no longer needed. While filters automatically timeout after a period of inactivity (typically 5 minutes), it's best practice to manually uninstall filters to properly manage resources.

## Use Cases

- Properly terminating event listeners when monitoring is complete
- Cleaning up resources in dApps to prevent memory leaks
- Managing the complete filter lifecycle from creation to removal
- Optimizing node resources by removing unused filters
- Reducing API quota usage with service providers
- Preventing unexpected filter timeout errors
- Cleaning up after data collection tasks finish
- Implementing proper application shutdown procedures

## Method Details

This method takes a filter ID and removes the corresponding filter.

<ApiMethodBlock
  chain="ethereum"
  scheme={{
    "method": "eth_uninstallFilter",
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
  }}
  fields={[
    {
      id: 'filterId',
      required: true,
      type: 'string',
      desc: "The filter ID to uninstall",
      value: "0x1a4b0d22dbb7284cf485c969d2857ab3"
    }
  ]}
  returns={[
    {
      id: 'result',
      type: 'boolean',
      desc: "true if the filter was successfully uninstalled, false otherwise"
    }
  ]}
  getParams={(fields) => [fields?.filterId || null]}
/>

### Response Example

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": true
}
```

### Return Values

- **true**: The filter was successfully uninstalled
- **false**: The filter could not be found or was already uninstalled

### Why Uninstall Filters

While most Ethereum nodes automatically expire filters after a period of inactivity (typically 5 minutes), there are several reasons to explicitly uninstall filters:

1. **Resource Management**: Active filters consume memory and processing resources on the node
2. **Filter Limits**: Some nodes implement limits on the number of active filters per connection
3. **API Usage Optimization**: Using fewer resources may reduce API costs with commercial providers
4. **Application Control**: Explicit lifecycle management allows your application to know exactly when a filter is active
5. **Prevent Timeouts**: Avoids unexpected "filter not found" errors when a filter times out automatically
6. **Clean Shutdown**: Allows your application to properly clean up when terminating

### Error Handling

When uninstalling filters, you might encounter the following scenarios:

1. **Filter Already Removed**:
   - Attempting to uninstall a filter that was already uninstalled returns `false`
   - No error is thrown

2. **Invalid Filter ID**:
   - Attempting to uninstall a filter with an invalid ID format may result in an error
   - Response will contain an error object instead of a result

3. **Filter Expired**:
   - If a filter automatically expired due to inactivity, uninstalling it returns `false`
   - No error is thrown

### Best Practices

1. **Always clean up filters** when they are no longer needed
2. **Handle connection interruptions** by tracking active filters and reinstalling them
3. **Implement timeout handling** for when filters expire automatically
4. **Add uninstall calls** to application shutdown procedures
5. **Check the return value** to verify successful uninstallation
6. **Keep track of active filters** in your application state
7. **Don't assume uninstall will succeed** - verify the result
8. **Implement retry logic** for critical filter removal

### Filter Types

This method works with all filter types created by:

1. `eth_newFilter` - Event log filters
2. `eth_newBlockFilter` - New block notification filters
3. `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` - Pending transaction filters
