# txpool_status

The `txpool_status` method returns the number of transactions in the pending and queued states in the transaction pool. This method provides a quick overview of the transaction pool size and network congestion without retrieving detailed transaction data.

## Use Cases

- Monitoring transaction pool size for network health checks
- Detecting network congestion to adjust gas prices
- Node performance monitoring in infrastructure setups
- Transaction backlog assessment for timing critical operations
- Estimating transaction inclusion time for user feedback
- Mempool analytics for research and optimization
- Gas price strategy optimization for faster confirmations
- Visualizing network activity in dashboards
- Detecting unusual transaction patterns
- Building gas price recommendation engines

## Method Details

This method requires no parameters and returns a count of transactions in each state.

### Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"result": {
		"pending": "0x21c",
		"queued": "0xa5"
	}
}
```

### Understanding the Response

The response contains two hexadecimal values:

- **pending**: Number of pending transactions (e.g., `"0x21c"` = 540 transactions)
- **queued**: Number of queued transactions (e.g., `"0xa5"` = 165 transactions)

To convert hexadecimal to decimal:

- `"0x21c"` → 540 (pending transactions)
- `"0xa5"` → 165 (queued transactions)

### Transaction States

- **Pending**: Transactions eligible for inclusion in the next block
- Have valid nonces (equal to the sender's current nonce)
- Meet all other validity criteria
- Ready to be mined

- **Queued**: Transactions not yet eligible for execution
- May have future nonces (higher than sender's current nonce + pending count)
- May have other constraints preventing immediate execution
- Waiting for prerequisites to be met

### Network Congestion Indicators

The transaction pool counts can indicate network congestion:

| Pending Count | Queued Count | Network Status     |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| < 100         | < 50         | Low activity       |
| 100-500       | < 100        | Normal activity    |
| 500-2000      | 100-500      | High activity      |
| > 2000        | > 500        | Network congestion |

_Note: These are approximate ranges and can vary based on network conditions._

### Important Notes

- This method is primarily supported by Geth clients
- Not all Ethereum client implementations support the txpool namespace
- The counts are returned as hexadecimal strings, not decimal numbers
- A high pending count might indicate network congestion or low gas prices
- A high queued count might indicate many future transactions or improper nonce sequencing
- These counts can change rapidly with each new block and incoming transaction
- During periods of high activity, these numbers can spike significantly
- Zero values for both indicate an empty transaction pool or a newly synced node
