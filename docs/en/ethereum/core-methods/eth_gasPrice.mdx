# eth_gasPrice

The `eth_gasPrice` method returns the current gas price in wei. This value represents the median gas price from recent blocks, providing developers with a reliable baseline for transaction fee calculations and helping users avoid transaction failures due to low gas prices.

## Use Cases

- Transaction fee estimation for wallets and DApps
- Setting appropriate gas prices for urgent transactions
- Price monitoring and alerts for optimal transaction timing
- Gas price tracking for analytics dashboards
- Transaction optimization to reduce costs
- MEV protection strategies to avoid front-running
- Historical gas price analysis
- Fee calculators and user-friendly gas interfaces

## Method Details

This method provides a simple way to query the current network gas price. It requires no parameters and returns a single hexadecimal value representing the gas price in wei.

<ApiMethodBlock
	chain="ethereum"
	scheme={{
		method: 'eth_gasPrice',
		id: 1,
		jsonrpc: '2.0',
	}}
	fields={[]}
	returns={[
		{
			id: 'result',
			type: 'string',
			desc: 'Current gas price in wei (hexadecimal)',
		},
	]}
	getParams={() => []}
/>

### Response Example

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"result": "0x1DCD65000" // 8 Gwei
}
```

### Understanding Gas Units

Gas prices are typically discussed in these units:
- **Wei**: The smallest unit (returned by this method)
- **Gwei**: 1 billion wei (10^9), the common unit for gas prices
- **Ether**: 10^18 wei, the main currency unit

For user interfaces, converting the returned value to Gwei usually provides a more readable format. For example, `0x1DCD65000` (8 Gwei) is easier to understand than 8,000,000,000 wei.

### Common Use Case Example

```javascript
// Example of calculating gas cost for a standard transfer
const gasPrice = await provider.send('eth_gasPrice', []);
const gasPriceInGwei = parseInt(gasPrice, 16) / 1e9;
const standardTransferGas = 21000;
const costInEth = (parseInt(gasPrice, 16) * standardTransferGas) / 1e18;
```

### Important Notes

- On EIP-1559 enabled networks, this method returns a value suitable for legacy transactions
- For EIP-1559 transactions, consider using `eth_feeHistory` to determine appropriate `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` values
- Gas prices can fluctuate rapidly during periods of high network activity
- Some providers may add their own estimates or adjustments to this value
