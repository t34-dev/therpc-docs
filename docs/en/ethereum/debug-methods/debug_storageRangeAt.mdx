# debug_storageRangeAt

The `debug_storageRangeAt` method returns the contract storage for a specified range. This method is primarily used for debugging purposes and allows developers to inspect and analyze on-chain storage data. It's commonly used by development tools like Remix to implement debugging features and provides direct access to the raw storage slots of a smart contract.

## Use Cases

- **Smart Contract Debugging**: Inspect specific storage values to identify state-related bugs in your contracts
- **Contract State Analysis**: Analyze how contract state changes during execution of different functions
- **Storage Layout Verification**: Verify that your contract's storage layout matches your expectations
- **Contract Auditing**: Examine storage slots to find security vulnerabilities or unexpected state changes
- **Development Tool Integration**: Build debugging tools that can visualize contract state and memory
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Investigate contract state after failures or exploits
- **Proxy Contract Verification**: Verify slot assignments in upgradeable proxy patterns
- **Governance Inspection**: Review storage state for DAO or governance contracts
- **Historical State Analysis**: Compare storage values across different blocks to track state evolution

## Method Details

This method returns storage entries for a contract within a specified range.

### Response Fields Explained

- **storage**: Object containing each storage entry as a key-value pair.
- The key is the keccak256 hash of the storage slot.
- Each entry contains:
- **key**: The original storage key (slot number).
- **value**: The value stored at this key.
- **nextKey**: The next storage key to start from when retrieving the next batch, or absent if no more entries.

### Understanding Storage Slots

In Ethereum smart contracts, storage is organized in 32-byte slots:

- **Slot 0, 1, 2, ...**: Simple state variables are stored sequentially.
- **Mappings**: Stored at `keccak256(key . slot)` where `.` is concatenation.
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Length at `slot`, data at `keccak256(slot) + index`.
- **Nested Mappings**: Use multiple hashing steps.

### Performance Considerations

- Querying large storage ranges can result in significant response sizes
- Consider using smaller limits for contracts with extensive storage
- Using a precise startKey helps reduce unnecessary data transfer
- This method is more resource-intensive than basic storage queries

### Important Notes

- This method is primarily used by development tools like Remix and other Ethereum IDEs
- Requires the debug API to be enabled on the Ethereum node
- Not all Ethereum clients support this method (fully supported in Geth and some others)
- For accurate results, use block hash and transaction index that reflect the desired state
- The limit parameter helps manage response size for contracts with large storage
- Some archive nodes might impose limits on storage range queries
- The method returns raw storage values which may require additional parsing for complex data types
- Cannot be used to read private variables directly as they may be packed into the same storage slot
- Historical queries require an archive node; non-archive nodes only support recent blocks
